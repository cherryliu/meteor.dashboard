Asteriod is a template meteor app that sets up some basic functionality that
you'll need for any application:
* Flash messages
* User accounts
* Routing
* Server callbacks
* Page header and footer
* Bootstrap

To use, simply clone this repo, change into the directory, and type:
<pre>
meteor
</pre>

Meteor will handle installing all of the package dependencies and will startup 
your application.
